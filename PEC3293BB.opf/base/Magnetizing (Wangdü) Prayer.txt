Magnetizing Prayer
by Trulshik Adeu Rinpoche

om ah hung hrih
oṃ āḥ hūṃ hrīḥ
gyurmé yeshe ösal chökü ying
In the luminous dharmakāya space of unchanging primordial wisdom,
zakmé rangjung ö nga trukpé shying
A realm where immaculate, self-arisen lights of five colours flicker,
dechen pema khyilwé podrang né
Is the palace of the swirling lotuses of great bliss;
tsemé tukjé tsewé jé chakpé
From which, moved by the intense love of boundless compassion,
samyé gyutrul drawé rol gar lé
Arise unimaginable, dance-like displays of illusory manifestation:
sortok yeshe ziji ö tayé
Amitābha, ‘Boundless Light’, the brilliance of discerning wisdom,
jikten wangchuk pema gar gyi wang
Padma Naṭeśvara, ‘Lotus Lord of the Dance’, master of all the world,
khordé chipal wangchen ta dong shyé
Mighty Hayagrīva, universal splendour of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa,
kham sum wangdü pema gyalpo chok
Sublime Pema Gyalpo, ‘Lotus King’, who controls the three realms,
dechen sangwa yeshe dakki ma
Guhyajñāna, ‘Secret Wisdom’, ḍākinī of great bliss,
sishyi ngö kün wang dzé rikjé wang
Kurukullā, magnetizer of everything in existence and quiescence,
nangsi zilnön demchok döpé gyal
Saṃvara, king of desire who subjugates appearance and existence,
gön mar chakpé dorjé drek tsok dul
Red Mahākāla, passionate vajra, subduer of the arrogant hordes,
si sum wang dzé lhachen tsok kyi dak
Great deity Gaṇapati, magnetizer of the triple world,
kham sum yiguk trowo döpé gyal
Wrathful Ṭakkirāja, captivator of the three realms,
jikten mepo wangchuk lha chenpo
Lord Mahādeva, progenitor of all the world,
dechen gyé gü gar rol döwang ma
Mistress of desire, playful emanation of every form of bliss and delight,
sishyi lektsok wangdü gesar gyal
King Gesar, attractor of all that is good in existence and quiescence—
wang gi lé la nga nyé tsa sum lha
Three Root deities who have mastered the activity of magnetizing,
sangwa gyé dé gar rol pawö dé
Heroic warriors who enjoy the secret play of bliss and delight,
yichen tenpa trok dzé daki tsok
Hosts of ḍākinīs who captivate the minds of all,
detong gyumé gar gyi jé chak zuk
In your seductive guise of illusory bliss and emptiness,
dzé ji ku yi gar gyi namkha gang
Let your beautiful, impressive dance of form fill the whole of space,
gakmé sung gi nyen gyur tong kham khyab
Let the ceaseless melody of your speech pervade a thousand realms,
detong rigpé tsalnang khordé yo
And the expressions of your bliss-empty awareness move saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.
ngotsar wang gi trinlé lhatsok la
Wondrous deities of magnetizing activity,
dungwé soldeb tsewé jé gong té
Fervently I pray to you: consider me with your love.
shyi drol dak nyam yeshe jin chen gyi
Through the great blessing of basic freedom, pure and equal,
go sum dorjé sum du lhün dzok né
May my three doors be spontaneously perfected as the three vajras,
khordé chö kün dechen tikler dum
And the whole of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa enter the sphere of great bliss.
nangsi wangdü choktün ngödrub tsol
Grant me supreme and ordinary siddhis for magnetizing appearance and existence, I pray.

When the sublime Khenpo Karga, who personifies the oceanic qualities of steadfast discipline
and erudition, repeatedly said that I should compose a magnetizing prayer such as this and
offered an excellent image of the Teacher as a gift, I, the one named Druprik Khyuchok,
wrote and offered whatever came to mind, simply to avoid turning down his request. May it
prove meaningful!
